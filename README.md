# CORToViz
## CORD-19 Topic Visualizer
CORToViz is an interactive application that demonstrates the results of unsupervised topic modeling experiments on CORD-19, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset.

In this project we aim to show the evolution of the topics of the abstracts of the dataset and we provide a statistical box to test hypotheses on the evolution of the topics.

A running demo is hosted at Politecnico di Milano's GeCo lab at [http://geco.deib.polimi.it/cortoviz](http://geco.deib.polimi.it/cortoviz).
